# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-plaid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.
### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- Visual Studio Code: My go-t for database management and executing SQL queries.
- Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.
Here's how I approached each question:
### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.
 ```sql
 SELECT 
    jf.job_title_short,
    cd.name, 
    jf.job_location,
    jf.salary_year_avg
FROM 
    job_postings_fact jf
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim cd ON jf.company_id = cd.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant
Salary potential in the
field.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. Top Paying Job Skills  
To determine which skills are most associated with high-paying remote data analyst roles, I joined the top-paying jobs with the skills required for each position. This query helps identify the most financially valuable skills in the job market.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT 
        job_id,
        jf.job_title_short,
        cd.name,
        jf.job_location,
        jf.salary_year_avg
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact jf
    LEFT JOIN
        company_dim cd ON jf.company_id = cd.company_id
    WHERE 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY 
        salary_year_avg DESC
)
SELECT 
    tj.job_title_short,
    tj.name,
    skills,
    tj.job_location,
    tj.salary_year_avg 
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs tj
INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim sj ON tj.job_id = sj.job_id
INNER JOIN
    skills_dim sd ON sj.skill_id = sd.skill_id
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top paying job skills:

- High-Value Skills: Skills such as SQL, Python, R, Azure, and Databricks are frequently listed in roles paying over $250,000.

INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim sj ON sd.skill_id = sj.skill_id
INNER JOIN
    job_postings_fact jf ON sj.job_id = jf.job_id
WHERE
    jf.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    jf.job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY
    jf.job_title_short,
    sd.skills
ORDER BY demand DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
